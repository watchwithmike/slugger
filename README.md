Sample application to illustrate the problems caused by [this AngularJS "feature"](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/12719).

This uses [this demo application](http://jsfiddle.net/msfrisbie/a0ywomq1/) from [The AngularJS Web Application Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angularjs-web-application-development-cookbook).

Plus a stripped down version of [this pushState demo](https://css-tricks.com/using-the-html5-history-api/).
